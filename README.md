# AWS-IAM-LearningProject

## Objective
The primary focus of this project was to gain basic hands-on experience with Identity Access Management(IAM) in a cloud environment (AWS). This project goes over creating and managing/configuring: users, roles, policies, permissions, & cross-account access with security best practices in mind.

### Skills Learned
- Create users, roles, & policies in the AWS IAM console and configure/implement them as needed
- Set permissions boundary for an IAM entity adhering principle of least privilege
- Test and debug IAM policies using the IAM policy simulator
  
### Tools Used
- AWS; specifically IAM console
- Command prompt(CMD) to retrieve account credentials and set access key ID, secret access key, & session token generated by the Security Token Service(STS)

### Tasks
This project is split into 12 tasks which build upon each other. Screenshots of basic instructions that occur throughout the project will be omitted at later tasks such as navigating to Users in the IAM dashboard. 

#### Task 1: Create and log in to your AWS account as a root user and set-up Multi-factor Authentication(MFA) as a security best practice
Create AWS account (https://aws.amazon.com/) > free account plan > input card and billing info > phone 2FA > account created > sign out > sign back in using root user email (default is IAM user sign in & root user is created automatically when AWS account is created) > add MFA pop-up > name the device > select method of authentication > app selected as I am an existing Google MFA app user > show QR code > in authenticator app, + button > scan a QR code > scan QR code with your authenticator app > enter 1st and 2nd code > register MFA > adding virtual MFA Success! > Continue to console.
