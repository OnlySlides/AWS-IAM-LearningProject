# AWS-IAM-LearningProject

## Objective
The primary focus of this project was to gain basic hands-on experience with Identity Access Management(IAM) in a cloud environment (AWS). This project goes over creating and managing/configuring: users, roles, policies, permissions, & cross-account access with security best practices in mind. 

Source: [Coursera: Security with AWS: Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://www.coursera.org/projects/security-with-aws-identity-and-access-management-iam-dvoa0)

### Skills Learned
- Create users, roles, & policies in the AWS IAM console and configure/implement them as needed
- Set permissions(perms) boundary for an IAM entity adhering principle of least privilege
- Test and debug IAM policies using the IAM policy simulator
  
### Tools Used
- AWS; specifically IAM console & a little EC2
- Command prompt(CMD) to retrieve account credentials and set access key ID, secret access key, & session token generated by the Security Token Service(STS)

### Tasks
This project is split into 12 tasks which build upon each other. Screenshots of basic instructions that occur throughout the project will be omitted at later tasks such as navigating to Users in the IAM dashboard. 

#### Task 1: Create and log in to your AWS account as a root user and set-up Multi-factor Authentication(MFA) as a security best practice.
Create AWS account (https://aws.amazon.com/) > free account plan > input card and billing info > phone 2FA > account created > sign out > sign back in using root user email (default is IAM user sign in & root user is created automatically when AWS account is created) > pop-up to add MFA > name the device > select method of authentication > app selected as an existing Google MFA app user > show QR code > in authenticator app, + button > scan a QR code > scan QR code with your authenticator app > enter 1st and 2nd code > register MFA > adding virtual MFA success <br/>
Continue to console > top-right account drop-down menu > Security credentials > MFA assigned > sign out of account and sign back in to test MFA.

#### Task 2: Create an IAM user and grant admin privileges/perms from the console as logging in as Root User is not a security best practice (principal of least privilege).
In console dashboard search bar at the top > IAM > click on IAM > IAM dashboard with 0 users > Click on Users on the left under Access management > Top right Create user > Input desired User name "SecurityTeamAdmin" > provide user access to the Console > specify "I want to create an IAM user" > Select Custom Password(pw) > input pw > for the purposes of this project, de-select new pw creation option. In the real-world, leave the option enabled so users need to create a new pw at next sign-in > Next > select 'Attach policies directly' > grant the SecurityTeamAdmin user two perms to work as an administrator and like a root user: AdministratorAccess & AWSAccountManagementFullAccess perms > Omit 'Set permissions boundary' > Next > Review > Create user. Console sign-in URL can be sent to the new user for them to access AWS in the real-world. CSV file can be downloaded for record purposes.

<br/>
  
Going forward, log in as the IAM user to access AWS resources. Root user account will only be used for emergency purposes. <br/>
Try to sign in as the SecurityTeamAdmin user: IAM dashboard > Users > click on the 1 under Users > copy the sign-in URL under AWS Account > sign out of root account > paste the URL > account ID of the master(root) account is auto filled > input IAM user credentials from earlier > sign in > sign in succesful!
